# product-inventory
This repository contains the sample code to demonstrate the use of various components of spring cloud like
eureka-server, zuul gateway, feign client, hystrix, config-server and microservice design architecture.

As I have used config-server to make a centralized configuration for all the service,
application.properties file for all the services can be found at [here](https://github.com/HarshadChovatiya/product-inventory-spring-cloud-config)
